Thanks to the contributors of https://github.com/server-status-project/server-status on which this repository is based.

I envisage this project will be able to be loaded into a subdomain of a website to provide simple notifications regarding the state of the website. This status will be publicly available, but updates willl be limited to  autorised administrators.
